        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken fried rice is a Chinese dish made with cooked rice that is stir-fried in a wok with chicken, vegetables, and eggs, and seasoned with a savory sauce.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large boneless skinless(≈300g) chicken breast</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Spring onion</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Cooked or cooled rice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the vegetables beforehand so they&apos;re ready to go when needed. Mince the garlic, grate the ginger, dice the carrot and bell pepper, slice the green onions (separate the green ends from the white ends), and measure the frozen peas.</li>
            <li>On a separate, clean cutting board, cut your chicken into ½ inch pieces so you get a little in every bite. Set aside (and wash your hands!)</li>
            <li>Lightly whisk the eggs in a small bowl. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 2 Tbsp of cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface. Add the eggs and gently scramble until cooked through. Transfer the cooked eggs to a clean bowl or plate off to the side.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat up to medium-high. Add the diced carrots, stir, and cook for about two minutes. Next, add the bell pepper and the white firm ends of the green onions. Cook and stir for one minute more. Finally, add the frozen peas and stir and cook until heated through. Transfer the vegetables to a clean bowl or plate.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 1 Tbsp cooking oil to the skillet and swirl to coat the surface. Add the ½ inch pieces of chicken and completely cook through, about 4 minutes. Once the chicken is about ½ of the way cooked through (2-3 minutes), add the garlic and ginger and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Then, add the cooked and cooled rice to the skillet. Stir and cook the chicken and rice together for about 2 minutes, or until the rice is heated through. Pour the soy sauce and toasted sesame oil over the rice. Stir the rice and sauce together until evenly combined. Turn the heat off.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs and vegetables back to the skillet with the chicken and rice and stir to combine. Allow the residual heat to heat everything through. Top with the remaining green ends of the sliced green onions. Taste and adjust the soy sauce or sesame oil to your liking.</li>
        </ol>
